# Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm
Ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be 
reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of 
real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.

Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization
tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.

ACO mimics the food hunting strategy of ants in the real world. The following figure depicts the behavior of ants to
find food with the passage of time.
